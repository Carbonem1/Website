						<p> Hey! I'm Michael Carbone. I am currently enrolled at Wentworth Institute of Technology persuing a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science with a minor in Biology. I am attending for my fourth year and expecting to graduate Summer, 2016. I am working at EMC as a software engineer intern for this semester. </p>
						<p> Alright, now that the formalities are out of the way... I'm a 21 year old living in Boston. I sleep all day and play video games all night, or at least that's the plan. </p>
